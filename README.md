	'date_posted': '31/10/2022',
	'closing_date': '30/11/2022',

### Notes
- The URLs scraped may not work as myjob.mu takes down a job post after a certain time. 
- The job URL was used as a primary key during scraping to avoid duplicate entries.
- `job_title` and `job_details` can be in French or English. 
- `salary` is not always disclosed.
- `date_posted` and `closing_date` are strings which follow `DD/MM/YYYY` format.
