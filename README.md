A web scraper for MyJobs.mu that checks the requirements of a particular job. For example, 
  - Look at all the ‘software developer’ jobs present in a job portal
  -  Analyze the job requirements 
  -  Plot a graph of frequency for each requirement using `graph` in python. 
  - Create a Top 10 skills in demand in Mauritius.
  - Create a pandas dataframe out of scraped data + maybe  use Jupyter Notebook

Inspired by the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, the goal of this Mauritian Developer Survey is to analyse the trends in technologies, in particular the technologies  in demand, in Mauritius.
